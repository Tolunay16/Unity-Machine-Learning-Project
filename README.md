# Unity-Machine-Learning-Project

The aim of this project is to design a project by integrating machine learning into the unit. I will explain the steps you need to take before starting the project.

1-You should download Unity and install the latest updates. Then start a 3D project ( This project was made with Unity 3.5.0 version.)(NET Framework 4.8 version is available.)

2-Install MLAgents library in your project 

3-Then install Python on your computer (You must install python version 3.19.3)

4-Go to your project's location, run the cmd command and perform the installations I will give below.

The pip package must be version 23.2.1.

Make the updates and download the libraries you see in the picture. You are now ready to start the project.

I will tell you what to do step by step.


1)Create an environment for our agents to stand on, a main agent to collect the balls, and the balls

Before starting machine learning you should create many examples as I showed and start machine learning

Once you get these results you can stop machine learning

Then enter the command mlagents -learn --run-id Trial 1 into cmd and start machine learning

Get the results from the results section and add them to the Assest folder.
