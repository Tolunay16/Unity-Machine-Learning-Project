Then open a code page and enter the codes in the Unity Part 1 section I gave above.

Then enter the command mlagents -learn --run-id Trial 1 into cmd and start machine learning

Get the results from the results section and add them to the Assest folder.

You can complete your project by doing the steps above in other parts.
