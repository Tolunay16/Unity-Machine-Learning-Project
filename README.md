# Unity-Machine-Learning-Project

The aim of this project is to design a project by integrating machine learning into the unit. I will explain the steps you need to take before starting the project.

PART 1 

You should download Unity and install the latest updates. Then start a 3D project ( This project was made with Unity 3.5.0 version.)(NET Framework 4.8 version is available.)

2-Install MLAgents library in your project 

3-Then install Python on your computer (You must install python version 3.19.3)

4-Go to your project's location, run the cmd command and perform the installations I will give below.

The pip package must be version 23.2.1.

Make the updates and download the libraries you see in the picture. You are now ready to start the project.

I will tell you what to do step by step.


1)Create an environment for our agents to stand on, a main agent to collect the balls, and the balls

Then open a code page and enter the codes in the Unity Part 1 section I gave above.

Before starting machine learning you should create many examples as I showed and start machine learning

Once you get these results you can stop machine learning

Then enter the command mlagents -learn --run-id Trial 1 into cmd and start machine learning

Get the results from the results section and add them to the Assest folder.

PART 2

In this part, we first created a rectangle around us. We make this a little bigger and make it square.

After this stage, you can enter the codes given in Part 2 and start machine learning work.

Part 3

You should open a folder named Prefab. In this way, the changes you make are applied to all other copies.

Then let's add a face to our agent for complete visual beauty.

Then we can add our code from Part 3 to our code page and start machine testing. You can stop the test when you get the results you see in the picture.

Part 4

What we need to do in this part is to create pellets randomly on the map and delete them from the map. Additionally, if our reward function collects all the pellets, our environment is set to be green and otherwise red.

Then you can start machine learning and stop it when you get these results.
